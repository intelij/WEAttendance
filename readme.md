# WeAttendance
> Attendance app using estimote ibeacons for the UVM Wellness Environment

## Release History

* 0.0.6
    * Went back to using beaconManager because MonitoringV2Manager is difficult to test with.

* 0.0.5
    * Nuked project, starting over again with the base app to test beacon functionalities.

* 0.0.2
    * Working on:
    *  We are currently working on designing the database we will be using to store the attendance data for the class.
    *  Added a temporary App Icon just to distinguish the app from other WE app on the phone. Once we create an actual App Icon, we will add those and all supporting sizes.
    * Added the third viewController from our wireframe. This screen will display the attendance data of the last 7 days. Also added a loading screen (should update this in future just like the app icon)
    * Removed Firebase and FirebaseDatabase pods and everything in the code relating to it to prepare for new database.

* 0.0.1
    * Base app that sends data to a firebase database when the user is within range of a beacon, whether the app is open or fully closed.
